### Main Classes
- **LibraryItem** – abstract class that represents a library resource such as Book and EBook. It consists of title, author, release_year.
- **Book** – represents a physical book, adding ISBN and page count.
- **EBook** - represents a digital book, adding file_format and file_size.
- **Reader** - represents a user who registers to the library. He can borrow books and return them.
- **Library** – manages the whole library system. You can add books, remove them, search for books or readers,
sort books by title or year and print all books or readers.

### OOP Principles

**Classes and Objects**: Books, Ebooks, Readers and Library are all classes with their own constructors and methods.

**Inheritance**: Book and EBook inherit from LibraryItem with super() adding abstraction.

**Encapsulation**: Availability is protected and only modified by the borrow and return_item methods, and if searched, 
it is done by a method in LibraryItem rather than using it directly with _availability.

**Polymorphism**: the borrow() and return_item() methods are overridden in Book and Ebook writing their own rules.
Book can be borrowed just once and EBook can be borrowed infinite times.
